# Documentation Archive

This folder stores historical planning and implementation-summary documents that are not part of the canonical documentation set.

Canonical docs remain in `documentation/`:

- `00-project-specs.md`
- `01-application-development.md`
- `99-potential-gaps.md`
- `README.md` (docs index)

## Layout

- `documentation/archive/2026-02/` - Historical planning/review/build docs moved from the root `documentation/` folder during reorganization.

These archived files are preserved for traceability and implementation history.
